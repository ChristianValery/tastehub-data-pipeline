# TasteHub Data Pipeline

Welcome to the TasteHub Data Pipeline project repository! This project simulates a real-time sales data processing pipeline for TasteHub, a fictional beverage and snack company. It leverages modern data engineering tools and techniques to achieve seamless data processing, visualization, and deployment.

## Project Overview

TasteHub Data Pipeline focuses on processing sales data streaming from various points of sale across Belgium, providing both real-time insights and historical analysis. We have incorporated a comprehensive suite of tools and technologies to maximize efficiency and scalability.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Data Processing:** Uses Kafka for data streaming and PySpark for distributed processing to handle large datasets efficiently.
- **Workflow Orchestration:** Utilizes Apache Airflow to manage and automate complex workflows.
- **Data Storage:** Employs a SQL database to store and query historical sales data for in-depth analysis.
- **Web Interface:** A Streamlit app provides interactive visualizations and dashboards for data exploration and insights.
- **Cloud Deployment:** The entire pipeline is deployed on AWS, taking advantage of cloud scalability and reliability.
- **Containerization:** Docker ensures environment consistency and simplifies deployment processes.
